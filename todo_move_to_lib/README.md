# Temporary location for not properly configured libs

I'm in the process of understanding how the workspaces system in uv works (apps vs. libs). The code in the subfolders here should become libraries later, but I don't understand how to configure the pyproject.toml and stuff correctly yet (uv docs are really quite confusing, or rather, unfortunately incomplete - there's no complete example to follow afaik).
