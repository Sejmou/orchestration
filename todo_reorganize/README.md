# Older existing code (to be reorganized)

I started reorganizing my code when I created the AI image detection worker (`workers/ai_image_detection`). Still working on getting that to work with the shared `flow-utils` library from this workspace (`lib/flow-utils`).

Once that works, I'll probably start rewriting the stuff here so that it also works with `flow-utils` (the code is otherwise quite a bit of a mess right now).
