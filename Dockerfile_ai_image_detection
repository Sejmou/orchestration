# Code adapted from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-docker-example/blob/main/multistage.Dockerfile
# NOTE: --mount relies on BuildKit which is NOT usable with the deploy() command (using this Dockerfile as base image) for prefect v3 flows (prefect.utilities.dockerutils.BuildError: the --mount option requires BuildKit. Refer to https://docs.docker.com/go/buildkit/ to learn how to build images with BuildKit enabled)
# IIUC, this is due to a limitation of an underlying dependency: https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/12922
# Therefore, I piped the original code through an AI and had it genereate a new Dockerfile that does not use --mount, but instead uses COPY to copy the files into the image.
